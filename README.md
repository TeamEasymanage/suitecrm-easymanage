**Why Project Repository Variations**

Since SuiteCRM has many tables the project gets very large. We are providing a *sample* project repository with 10 tables to get you started. Then extend it by copying more table related folders and files, as many needed, from *full* repository.

> **Tip** : 
> Start with downloading and setting up suitecrm-easymanage-sample repository!


> **Caution** :
> Downloading and setting up suitecrm-easymanage-full repository requires more computer and internet resources, needs to allocate higher memory sizes for heap/etc. Its > better to set it up on large server computer.
>
> Rather than running *full* projects, copy table-related folders/files to *sample* project and run.
